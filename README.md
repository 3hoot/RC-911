# RC-911: Custom 1/16 Scale RC Drift Car

## About This Project
RC-911 is a custom-built 1/16 scale RC drift car, inspired by the Porsche 911 964 Carrera 2 with an RWB body kit. The project also includes a custom standalone RC controller.

This repository serves as a comprehensive database and progress tracker for the project. Here, you'll find analyses of various components, working implementations, and open development tasks. Feel free to explore and use any shared resources.
